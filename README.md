Sencha demo to show the layout manager "border" style,
which is a layout that has five areas within it:

   * north (top)
   * west (left)
   * center (typically the main area of content)
   * east (right)
   * south (bottom)

The edge areas all have split-panel sliders for resizing areas,
and arrow icons to collapse the area to a small bar, then expand it.

This demo is based on the Sencha tutorials and documentation.
